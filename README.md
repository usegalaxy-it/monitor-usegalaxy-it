# monitor-usegalaxy-it

This repository contains Ansible playbooks, nginx configuration files, and a Dockerfile to deploy containers that host test job reports generated by SABER.

## Docker

### Saber
The provided Dockerfile creates a Docker image that runs the latest version of SABER. To work correctly alongside the SWAG Docker container, you need to set specific key/values through Docker CLI or Docker Compose:

```
saber:
  build:
    context: /etc/saber
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  image: <image-name>
  container_name: <name>
  volumes:
    - /dev/log:/dev/log # Mandatory, all saber logs will also be written in the syslog
    - /etc/saber/configs:/configs # Mandatory, folder containing the configuration files for saber.
    # Make sure the path in settings.yaml matches the path inside the container (/configs/settings.yaml and /configs/workflow.ga)
    - /etc/saber/logs:/logs
    - /etc/swag/configs/:/shared_data # It should match the SWAG volume to have the correct File Rotation of HTML outputs
  environment:
    SABER_PASSWORD: "${SABER_PASSWORD}"
    TZ: "Europe/Rome" # Optional, Defaults to UTC
```

The container relies on the host's cronjobs for test automation.

#### Saber Docker Entrypoint
The SABER container has an entrypoint that can be used to run SABER outside the cronjobs with the command:

```
docker exec <container-name> /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh run-once
```

For other bash commands use:
```
docker exec <container-name> /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh <other-bash-commands>
```

Additionally, the entrypoint script handles file rotation. The most recent `report.html` file is placed inside `/config/www` (`/shared_data/www` inside the SABER docker), while another copy is placed in `/config/www/reports` with date and time appended to its name. These files are rotated every 7 days.

### SWAG
The SWAG container is deployed alongside the SABER container, with nginx hosting the HTML reports on monitor.usegalaxy.it. The hosting takes advantage of the Autoreload feature to update webpages when the SABER container overwrites old reports and adds new entries to the index. Make sure to match the mounted volume with the SABER container and to enable SWAG_AUTORELOAD:

```
swag:
  image: lscr.io/linuxserver/swag:latest
  container_name: example
  environment:
    SWAG_AUTORELOAD: "true"
    SWAG_AUTORELOAD_WATCHLIST: "/config/www"
  volumes:
    - /etc/saber/swag:/config # Note how this folder is the same used by saber
```

## Playbook
The playbook can deploys both of the two Docker containers on the chosen host. It uses the compose.yaml file for most of the variables, although not all of them. The file is included for ease in case of manual test runs. To use it, make sure that this repository is the current working directory and run:

```
ansible-playbook -i <FQDN>, swag-playbook.yaml -u <user> -b --private-key <path-to-private-key> --extra-vars "password=<SABER_PASSWORD> cert_mail=<e-mail>"
```

The cronjob schedule can be edited inside the playbook. To build the SABER docker container, with the needed objects, alongside the SWAG container set `saber_docker` to `true`.

The files containing `jenkins` in their names are used alongside jenkins services, to launch test runs and move results files accordingly to our infrastructure, using only the SWAG container to host the results.
